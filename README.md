# Creator
This design was created by Rick Caudle also know as SSBelmont in the MultiGP Race community.  If you have any questions feel free to contact me on FaceBook or Instagram.

# Ventador-3-Inch-Frame
This is an open source frame licensed under the GNU GPLv3.  The goal of this design is to provide the community with good quality 3" frame that can be printed from a 3D printer.  I have had good luck using PETG and NylonX.

# Recommendations for a Quality 3D Print
I highly recommend that you reach out to Chris Griffin over at https://www.phx-3d.com/ and have him print you a frame.  Chris knows how to create quality prints.

# Contents
This repo has 3 sub-folders i.e. images\, Fusion 360 Files\ and STLs\  
All the design files are included in the Fusion 360 Files folder and as well as the STLs.  If you want to make any modifications I recommend that you leverage the Fusion 360 files as it's much easier to work with

# Design Details
The frame is designed to supper any of the Whoop style AIO boards.  The FV/AIO that I prefer to use is the BetaFPV 20a AIO.  These boards use a 26.5x26.5 hole spacing.

The canopy supports any Nano camera that is a 14x14 form factor, I personally use the Racer Nano.  You can use any Canopy that will work on a Whoop that leverages 26.5x26.5 spacing, several of these can be found on Thingiverse.

The Lipo tray is designed around that 3s Tattu 550 so it fits perfectly.  

# Print Details
I have printed this out of PETG and NylonX and both work well, but I would highly recommend one of the reinforment versions as they are much more durable.  If you don't hit anything at full speed the v1.0 will hold up, but if you are flying 100% throttle like we do, you are going to break the frame eventually.  

I have yet to try armadillo material but it might work well as it's stiffer than TPU but does have some flex.  I think if you use PETG on one of the reinforment frames you will be happy.
